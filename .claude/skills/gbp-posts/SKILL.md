  Google Business Profile (GBP) post creation rules. Claude reads this before
  writing any GBP post — local business Google posts, map-pack updates, Offer /
  Event / Call-to-action posts. Enforces the ONLY three valid Make.com
  post_type values ("Call to action", "Event", "Offer"), the exact webhook
  payload/YAML output format, justification-baiting (service variant +
  neighborhood + long-tail problem), cadence, length limits, winning copy
  formulas, image queries, and the posts-queue dedupe system. Use whenever the
  user asks to write, draft, schedule, or generate a GBP / Google Business
  Profile post, a local SEO post, a "Google post", a map-pack offer, or content
  that POSTs to the Make.com GBP webhook. Pairs with tone.md, humour.md,
  vocabulary.md, business-context.md.

# GBP Posts · creation rules

> Claude reads this before writing any GBP post.
> Pairs with `tone.md`, `humour.md`, `vocabulary.md`, `business-context.md`.
> Output queues into `posts-queue.md` AND POSTs to Make.com webhook.

## 🚫 Critical failure modes (DO NOT)

These are the most common mistakes that break the Make.com router. **NEVER produce any of these:**

❌ **`type: update`** — wrong field name AND wrong value
❌ **`type: standard`** — `STANDARD` is not a valid Make.com post type
❌ **`type: product`** — not a Make.com post type, use `"Call to action"` instead
❌ **`type: news`** / **`type: announcement`** / **`type: tip`** — none are valid
❌ **`cta: Book`** — wrong field name, use `cta_action: BOOK` + `cta_url: ...`
❌ **Markdown body below the `---`** — body lives INSIDE `summary: |`
❌ **`**bold**` or `[link]()` in summary** — plain text only

✅ **The ONLY valid `post_type` values:**
- `"Call to action"` (with quotes · has a space)
- `"Event"`
- `"Offer"`

✅ **Use `post_type:` as the field name** — NOT `type:`

✅ **Body goes INSIDE `summary: |`** as plain text — not as markdown below the YAML

If you find yourself about to output `type: update` — STOP. The correct output is `post_type: "Call to action"` with the body inside `summary: |`.

## Webhook configuration

> Set these once during client onboarding.
> The skill POSTs every generated post to `MAKE_WEBHOOK_URL`.
> Make.com routes it to the right GBP using `GBP_LOCATION_NAME`.

```yaml
MAKE_WEBHOOK_URL: https://hook.us2.make.com/uww8m1lhwrc4plnjc1wyqf27vtp65kn2   # webhook "gmb-posting", hook 2313632
GBP_ACCOUNT_NAME: accounts/106000043317271680047                                # Jonathan Catliff
GBP_LOCATION_NAME: locations/7507144406014431820                                # The Brotherhood - Therapy for Men
DEFAULT_CTA_URL: https://www.thebrotherhood.ca
```

**How to get these:**

1. **MAKE_WEBHOOK_URL** — In Make.com: create a new scenario → add "Webhooks · Custom webhook" trigger → copy the URL it generates
2. **GBP_ACCOUNT_NAME** — In Make.com: add "Google Business Profile · List Accounts" → run once → copy the `name` (format: `accounts/12345678`)
3. **GBP_LOCATION_NAME** — In Make.com: add "Google Business Profile · List Locations" → run once → copy the `name` (format: `locations/87654321`)
4. **DEFAULT_CTA_URL** — The client's main domain · fallback when the post doesn't specify a deeper page

---

## ⚠️ Live scenario notes (`GBP posting` · The Brotherhood)

> Reconciled against the actual Make.com blueprint (`GBP posting`, zone `us2.make.com`).
> These describe how the **current** scenario behaves — until the scenario is fixed,
> generate posts with these constraints in mind.

- **Account + location are hardcoded** in every router branch. The payload's `account_name` / `location_name` are ignored — you can still send them (harmless), but the real routing is baked into the scenario (values above).
- **CTA button is always `LEARN_MORE`.** The Call-to-action branch hardcodes `actionType: LEARN_MORE` instead of mapping `{{1.cta_action}}`. So `cta_action: BOOK / CALL / SIGN_UP …` is currently **ignored** — every CTA post renders a "Learn more" button. To honor the payload, the mapper needs `actionType: {{1.cta_action}}`. Still send `cta_action` so it works once fixed.
- **Event posts are broken.** The `Event` branch is a copy-paste of the Offer branch (`select: offer`, maps `couponCode` + `redeemOnlineUrl`, which the module marks **required**). An `"Event"` payload therefore either posts as an Offer or errors on the missing coupon fields. **Do not queue `post_type: "Event"` posts until the branch is fixed** (`select` → `event`, remove the coupon mappings). Prefer `"Call to action"` or `"Offer"`.
- **`terms_conditions` is not mapped** in the Offer branch — it's fine to generate it, but it won't reach GBP until the mapper adds `termsConditions: {{1.terms_conditions}}`.
- **`media_items` is 1-indexed** in Make (`{{1.media_items[1]}}` = first image). Send it as an array; the scenario uses only the first item, format `PHOTO`.

---

## Cadence

- **1-2 posts per week** · weekly is the minimum
- Updates lose prominence after **7 days** · Events + Offers stay visible until end date
- **Don't post daily** — looks spammy, no extra benefit
- **Consistency > volume** — 1/week for 12 weeks beats 12 in 1 week

---

## Length (real-world data)

Real high-performing posts run **shorter than most guides claim**:

| Type | Sweet spot | Max |
|---|---|---|
| **Offer / Flash sale** | 25-50 words | 80 |
| **Event** | 30-60 words | 100 |
| **Update (announcement)** | 30-80 words | 150 |
| **Update (story / case study)** | 100-200 words | 300 |
| **Product spotlight** | 30-60 words | 100 |

**First 100 characters are critical** — that's what shows before "see more."

---

## Structure (every post)

- **Plain text only** — NO markdown (`**bold**`, `[link]()`, etc.) · GBP renders it literally
- **Title** (60-80 chars) — the headline/hook · separate from body
- **Summary / body** (plain text, 25-300 words depending on type)
- **Image required** · 1,200 × 900 px (4:3 ratio)
- **CTA action required** · BOOK / CALL / LEARN_MORE / SIGN_UP / ORDER / SHOP
- **CTA URL** required if action ≠ CALL
- **Local reference** baked in (neighborhood, city, landmark)
- **Justification keyword** included (specific service variant)
- **First 100 chars** = strong hook
- **Emojis OK** · 2-3 max · render fine as Unicode

---

## Images · default = stock

**Default approach: pull a stock image that matches the post topic.** Fastest, easiest, works for 90% of cases.

For each post, Claude outputs an `image_query:` field — a 3-5 word search query the user pastes into Unsplash / Pexels / Pixabay to grab a relevant free image.

Example: `image_query: "plumber fixing water heater"` → user grabs from Unsplash in 10 seconds → done.

**Quality hierarchy** (for clients who want to level up):

1. **Real client photos** — best, but requires onboarding effort
2. **AI-generated** via fal.ai (Nano Banana, Imagen) — great for unique product shots
3. **Stock photos** ← default, easiest
4. ❌ Skip the post entirely if no image — engagement drops ~60% without one

---

## Monthly mix (at 2x/week = 8 posts)

| Type | Count | % | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Offer** | 4 | 50% | Highest converter · yellow "Limited Time" badge in map pack · clearest CTA |
| **Update** | 2-3 | 30% | Seasonal tips, customer stories · freshness signal |
| **Event** | 0-1 | 10% | Only when you actually have one |
| **Product / Service** | 1 | 10% | New launches, bestsellers |

---

## Justification baiting (3 layers per post)

Every post should naturally include all three. This triggers Google's "Their post mentions..." snippets.

1. **Service variant** — specific phrasing
  - ✅ "tankless water heater install" / "drain camera inspection" / "burst pipe repair"
  - ❌ "plumbing services" (too generic)

2. **Neighborhood / area** — explicit local reference
  - ✅ "Riverdale", "East York", "King St W"
  - ❌ "the city" (too vague)

3. **Long-tail problem** — the customer's exact phrase
  - ✅ "basement smells like sewage in winter"
  - ✅ "no hot water on weekends"

---

## ⚠️ Valid `post_type` values (ONLY these 3)

The `post_type` field accepts **exactly one of these three strings** — spelled exactly as Make.com expects. Any other value will break the router.

| Value (exact) | What it is | Required extras |
|---|---|---|
| `"Call to action"` | Post with an action button | `cta_action` + `cta_url` |
| `"Event"` | Post with start + end dates (workshops, open houses, anniversaries) | `start_date` + `end_date` |
| `"Offer"` | Promo with coupon code (yellow badge in map pack) | **ALL REQUIRED:** `coupon_code` + `redeem_online_url` + `start_date` + `end_date` · optional: `terms_conditions` |

---

### 🚨 Offer posts · required field generation rules

Make.com's GBP module marks these as **required** for Offer posts. Claude must ALWAYS generate them — no nulls, no empty strings:

**1. `coupon_code` — always generate a unique short code**

Format: `[KEYWORD][NUMBER]` or `[KEYWORD][CAMPAIGN]` · 6-12 chars · UPPERCASE · no spaces

Examples:
- `TANKLESS50` (tankless install · $50 off)
- `WINTER25` (winter promo · 25% off)
- `FREECONSULT` (free consultation)
- `BROTHER1ST` (Brotherhood first-time client)
- `BURSTFIX` (burst pipe service)

Why: tracks which posts drove redemptions + Make.com requires non-empty.

**2. `redeem_online_url` — always set**

Default: `DEFAULT_CTA_URL` from webhook config (the client's main domain).
Better: a deeper page with the offer pre-applied: `https://client.com/book?promo=TANKLESS50`

**3. `start_date` — always set**

Default: today (the `publish_date`). ISO 8601 format with America/Toronto offset:
`"2026-05-15T00:00:00-04:00"`

**4. `end_date` — always set**

Default: 7 days from `start_date`. ISO 8601 format:
`"2026-05-22T23:59:59-04:00"`

Why 7 days: matches GBP's default offer visibility window. Longer = less urgency. Shorter = misses traffic.

**5. `terms_conditions` — optional but recommended**

Default if missing: `"Cannot be combined with other offers."`

**Every post must be one of these three.** Make.com has no "plain" post type — every post needs at minimum a CTA button.

When formulas below say "Update post" or "Product post" — those are **content categories**, not webhook values. Map them to the right `post_type`:

| Formula category | Maps to `post_type` |
|---|---|
| Offer / Flash sale / Discount | `"Offer"` |
| Update / Announcement / News / Tip / Customer story | `"Call to action"` (with "Learn more") |
| Event / Workshop / Open house | `"Event"` |
| Product / Service spotlight | `"Call to action"` (with "Book" / "Order" / "Shop") |

## Winning formulas by post type

### 🟡 OFFER posts — the highest-converting type

**Formula A: Price + Service + Location + Deadline**

```
[$ off] [specific service] in [neighborhood]. [Deadline].
[1-line social proof or detail]
CTA: Book / Get offer
```

**Example:**

> 12-year warranty · 4-hr install · same-day quotes.
> [Book →]

**Formula B: Flash sale shorthand**

```
⚡ [TIME-LIMIT] [DEAL TYPE]
[What's included]
[Deadline + urgency hook]

### 📢 UPDATE posts — freshness + expertise

**Formula A: Seasonal tip with local hook**

```
[Season] is here. [Number] things every [city/neighborhood] [customer-type] should do before [trigger].
[Optional bullets]
CTA: Learn more
```

**Example:**
> Burst pipe season is here. 3 things every Toronto basement owner should do before -10°C.

> [Learn more →]

**Formula B: Customer story / case study**

```
[Time] emergency call · [neighborhood] · [problem]
[1-2 sentences: what we found, how we fixed it]
[Outcome for customer]
CTA: Call now
```

**Example:**
> 2am emergency call from a Riverdale family — flooded basement, burst pipe in the wall.
> Mike was on-site in 28 minutes. Found the break, isolated the line, patched it before the hardwood swelled.
> They were dry by sunrise. This is why we run 24/7.
> [Call now →]

**Formula C: Counter-intuitive tip**

```
Why your [problem] in [season] — and the [$0 / surprising] fix most [pros] don't share.
[1-2 sentence explanation]
CTA: Learn more

> When your P-traps dry out from low humidity, sewer gas seeps up through your floor drain. Pour a cup of water down it once a month.
> [Learn more →]

---

### 📅 EVENT posts — date-anchored urgency

**Formula: Event + Date + Hook + RSVP**

```
[🎉 emoji] [Event name] · [date] · [location]
[1-2 sentence value prop]
[Practical detail: cost, who it's for, spots]
CTA: RSVP / Sign up
```

**Example:**
> 🍳 Learn to Cook Authentic Italian Pasta!
> Saturday Jan 20, 2 PM · our King St W kitchen
> Hands-on workshop with Chef Marco. All skill levels welcome. Ingredients + recipes provided.
> $45/person · 12 spots only
> [RSVP →]

---

### 🛠️ PRODUCT / SERVICE posts — feature what's new

**Formula A: Product + speed claim + warranty**

```
[Product/service name]
[Speed/scope claim] · [warranty or trust signal] · [location served]
[Optional pricing tier]
CTA: See specs / Order online
```

**Example:**
> Tankless water heaters installed in 4 hours.
> 12-year warranty · same-day quotes across the GTA · financing available.
> [See specs →]

**Formula B: Before/after results**

```
[Service] result: [neighborhood] [property type]
[1-line description of work done]
[Result for customer]
CTA: Book
```

**Example:**
> Drain repair · East York semi-detached
> Replaced collapsed clay sewer line with PVC. 6-hour job, no driveway dig (we used a pipe-burst method).
> Homeowner saved $4,200 over the dig-and-replace quote.
> [Book →]

---

## CTA button selection

| Goal | CTA button |
|---|---|
| Convert to phone | Call now |
| Convert to booking | Book |
| Drive to website | Learn more |
| Capture lead | Sign up |
| Ecommerce | Buy / Order online |
| Promo redemption | Get offer |

**Never post without a CTA.** A post without a destination is a wasted slot.

---

## What NOT to do

- ❌ **Daily posting** — looks spammy
- ❌ **Generic content** — "Happy Monday from our team!"
- ❌ **Stock photos** without branding overlay
- ❌ **Keyword stuffing** — write naturally
- ❌ **Fake urgency** — "ENDS TONIGHT!" if it doesn't
- ❌ **Blog excerpts that link off-platform** — visitors are in decision mode
- ❌ **Posting without a photo** — drops engagement ~60%
- ❌ **Reusing copy across clients** — Google detects duplication

---

## The 4 mechanisms posts trigger (why we bother)

1. **Engagement signals** — clicks, calls, directions = behavioral ranking signal (~9% weight)
2. **AI Overview citations** — Gemini reads posts to write AI summaries about your business
3. **Profile freshness** — active profiles get small ranking preference · 90+ days quiet = inactive
4. **Offer badge conversion** — yellow "Limited Time Offer" tag visually steals clicks at current rank

---

## Output format → POST to Make.com webhook

Each generated post is **POSTed to a Make.com webhook URL** as plain-text JSON, then logged in `posts-queue.md` for deduping.

⚠️ **CRITICAL: The entire post is INSIDE the YAML frontmatter as fields. There is NO markdown body section below the closing `---`.**

❌ **WRONG (don't do this):**

```
---
type: update
cta: Book
---

# The same fight, every Sunday night

A client in Toronto came in...

[Book →]
```

✅ **RIGHT (always do this):**

```yaml
---
title: "The same fight, every Sunday night"
post_type: "Call to action"
summary: |
  A client in Toronto came in...
cta_action: BOOK
cta_url: "https://..."
---
```

The body text lives **inside `summary: |`** (the `|` preserves line breaks). No `**bold**`, no `[link]()`, no `# headings`. Plain text only.

## Make.com scenario: Router pattern (required)

⚠️ **The `Post type` field in Make.com's GBP module is STATIC** — it can't be mapped dynamically. Different post types expose different fields. So one webhook → **Router** → 4 separate GBP modules:

```
Webhook (custom)
       ↓
   Router (checks {{1.post_type}})
       ↓
   ┌────────────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
   ↓                ↓         ↓
Call to action    Event     Offer
(Title +         (Title +  (Title +
 Summary +        Summary + Summary +
 Action +         dates)    coupon +
 URL)                       dates)
```

**Router filter rules** (3 branches):

| Branch | Filter | GBP module config |
|---|---|---|
| **1 · Call to action** | `post_type` = `Call to action` | Post type: Call to action · Action type + URL |
| **2 · Event** | `post_type` = `Event` | Post type: Event · Start/End date |
| **3 · Offer** | `post_type` = `Offer` | Post type: Offer · Coupon + Redeem URL + Terms + dates |

---

**Webhook payload structure** — fields vary by `post_type`. Common fields are always present; type-specific fields are conditional:

### Common fields (every post type · always present)

```yaml
# === Common (sent to webhook for ALL post types) ===
account_name: "accounts/12345678"
location_name: "locations/87654321"
post_type: "Call to action"   # OR "Event" OR "Offer"
title: "60-80 char headline · plain text"
summary: |
  Body text · plain text · no markdown · 25-300 words
media_items:

```

---

### Type 1 · Call to action (with action button)

Use for: announcements, customer stories, tips, product spotlights, anything that drives action via a button.

```yaml
---
account_name: "accounts/12345678"
location_name: "locations/87654321"
post_type: "Call to action"
title: "The same fight, every Sunday night — until it wasn't"
summary: |
  A client in Toronto came in after the same Sunday-night argument
  with his wife had played out for 3 years straight.

  Six sessions of parts-based therapy later, he could see it:
  the anger wasn't about the dishes. It was a 14-year-old part of
  him bracing for criticism that wasn't actually coming.

  This is what online therapy for men in Ontario looks like when
  it's done right. First consultation is free.

### Field mapping in each Make.com router branch

| Make.com field | Call to action | Event | Offer |
|---|---|---|---|
| Account name | `{{1.account_name}}` | `{{1.account_name}}` | `{{1.account_name}}` |
| Location name | `{{1.location_name}}` | `{{1.location_name}}` | `{{1.location_name}}` |
| Title | `{{1.title}}` | `{{1.title}}` | `{{1.title}}` |
| Summary | `{{1.summary}}` | `{{1.summary}}` | `{{1.summary}}` |
| Media items | `{{1.media_items[]}}` | `{{1.media_items[]}}` | `{{1.media_items[]}}` |
| Action type | `{{1.cta_action}}` | — | — |
| URL | `{{1.cta_url}}` | — | — |
| Start date | — | `{{1.start_date}}` | `{{1.start_date}}` |
| End date | — | `{{1.end_date}}` | `{{1.end_date}}` |
| Coupon code | — | — | `{{1.coupon_code}}` |
| Redeem Online URL | — | — | `{{1.redeem_online_url}}` |
| Terms & Conditions | — | — | `{{1.terms_conditions}}` |

**The webhook flow:**

```
Claude generates post (plain text, structured)
       ↓
POST https://hook.make.com/[YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID]
       ↓
Make.com receives payload
       ↓
Make.com → Google Business Profile · Create Local Post
       ↓
Post goes live on GBP within minutes
       ↓
Make.com responds with success/error
       ↓
Claude updates posts-queue.md:
  status: published
  published_at: 2026-05-15T09:00:00Z
```

**Make.com scenario setup (one-time):**

1. Create scenario · trigger = **Webhook (custom)**
2. Copy webhook URL
3. Add module: **Google Business Profile → Create Local Post**
4. Map webhook fields → GBP module fields:
  - `title` → Title
  - `summary` → Summary
  - `post_type` → Post type
  - `cta_action` + `cta_url` → CTA
  - `start_date` / `end_date` → Start/End date (for OFFER/EVENT)
  - `media_url` → Media items
  - `location_name` → Location Name
5. Save + activate scenario
6. Paste webhook URL into Claude Code skill config

**Critical: NO markdown in `summary:` or `title:`**
- ❌ `**bold**` → renders as literal asterisks in GBP
- ❌ `[Book →](url)` → renders as literal brackets
- ❌ `# headings` → renders as literal hash signs
- ✅ Plain text with line breaks only
- ✅ Emojis (Unicode) render fine
- ✅ Links go in `cta_url:` field, not in body

## The queue file system

`posts-queue.md` lives in the project. Sections:

```markdown
# Posts Queue

## Pending
[posts ready to publish · status: pending]

## Scheduled
[posts queued in Make.com · status: scheduled]

## Published (last 90 days)
[posts already live · status: published]

## Archive
[older than 90 days]
```

**Why this works:**
- Claude reads "Published" before generating to avoid duplicates
- No external dependency (no Sheets, no DB)
- Stays in version control with the skill
- Trackable history per client
